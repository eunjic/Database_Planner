Project Title
==============
Self Checking Planner 

Motivation
===============
In order to manage my schedule and to have self assesment of it, I proposed a simple Self Checking Planner using database. 

Description
===============
This project was focused on establishing simple database system. 
I used MySQL, Apache servers in my local PC, included two tables (To Do table, Finished table) and elso design appropriate user interface using PHP and HTML.
The class '데이터베이스이론및실습' was time-consuming according to my shallow knowledge of database concept, but it was very useful.
I learned how the total database system works and gained ability to design database suitable in purpose. 
(Indeed, I also learned theoric knowledge including database command language.)
